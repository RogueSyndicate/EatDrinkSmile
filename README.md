Website Goal & Idea

Eat. Drink. Smile. will ensure that visitors to our site will always be guaranteed with a food destination that will leave them happy and smiling. With the correct combination of resources we believe we can provide the best service out there with regards to finding the perfect meal whether it’s breakfast, lunch, or dinner.

Why do you need E.D.S.?

- Have you ever been in a situation where you want to eat something but you just don’t know what you want?
- E.D.S. is going to locate a list of various food places near the location provided by the user and output a set of results.
- The user then can go through the list to find a place that would satisfy their needs or simply try a new place.
- The list of food locations will be based on the closest major city near them. 
- Upon completion of the site, E.D.S. will only be able to work on locations in New Brunswick but we will expand to other cities as well over time.

How did we make this happen?

- E.D.S will be running on three different API’s in order to source and pool together information for the user
- The APIs include:
  - Google Maps: to locate and plan the trip to the chosen location
  - Twitter: to find tweets about restaurants
  - Instagram: to gather pictures of the place
